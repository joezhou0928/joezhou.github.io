      <p>
          I have been a <a href = "https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Swiftie">Swiftie</a> for 10 years. I started listening to English songs
          when I was in junior high and that was the time I discovered this talented artist. Music has always been my friend along the way and one of the big reasons 
          why I came to the U.S.. I enjoy mainstream pop, pop rock, country and indie pop the most.
      </p>
      <p>
          I am an advocate for diversity and equality--another reason why I love Taylor Swift. I admire those who contribute their power, no matter large or small, to making this a better community
          for everyone. I strongly recommend her documentary <a href = "https://www.netflix.com/title/81028336"><i>Miss Americana</i></a> and suggest everyone fight against 
        unjust behavior and support the minorities.

          features extracted from Quandl and sentiments extracted from Reddit world news. </p>

          <p>The model was trained on historical stock price data of 60 companies from 6 different
          industries combined with the top 25 news headlines on Reddit world news (on a daily
          basis for the last 8 years). These features were used to predict stock price trends
          through C5.0 Decision Tree with accuracy slightly greater than 70%.</p>

            Abstract— Cyber-attacks cost the global economy over $450 billion annually. To combat this issue, researchers and practitioners put enormous efforts into developing Cyber Threat Intelligence, or the process of identifying emerging threats and key hackers. However, the reliance on internal network data to has resulted in inherently reactive intelligence. CTI experts have urged the importance of proactively studying the large, ever- evolving online hacker community. Despite their CTI value, collecting data from hacker community platforms is a non-trivial task. In this paper, we summarize our efforts in systematically identifying and automatically collecting a large-scale of hacker forums, carding shops, Internet-Relay-Chat, and DarkNet Marketplaces. We also present our efforts to provide this data to the larger CTI community via the<a href = "www.azsecure-hap.com"> AZSecure Hacker Assets Portal</a>. With our methodology, we collected 102 platforms for a total of 43,902,913 records. To the best of our knowledge, this compilation of hacker community data is the largest such collection in academia, and can enable a numerous novel and valuable proactive CTI research inquiries.
