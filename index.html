          I have been a <a href = "https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Swiftie">Swiftie</a> for 10 years. I started listening to English songs
          when I was in junior high and that was the time I discovered this talented artist. Music has been my friend along the way and one of the big reasons 
          why I came to the U.S. I enjoy mainstream pop, pop rock, country and indie pop the most.
      </p>
      <p>
          If somebody asked me about my career goal, working as a data analyst/data scientist in the music industry would always be the answer.

            In this project, we aimed to explore the Pokémon spawning pattern with temporal and spatial

          </p>
          <p>
            We later utilized those features and metrics to develop a C5.0 Decision Tree prediction model for
            recommending the next most-likely spawned Pokémon for a given set of features.

          <p>This Python program aimes to simulate how memory (256 bytes) and register (16 bytes) interact while running machine code instructions. The program displays changes in Memory, Register, Program Counter, and Instruction Register step-by-step. The program was written under Jupyter Notebook (which is why there are many "In[#]" throughout my code) with Python 3. The GUI package used is tkinter.</p>

          <p>This program was developed for educational purpose for students in CSIM department at Soochow University in Taipei, Taiwan.

            Abstract— Cyber-attacks cost the global economy over $450 billion annually. To combat this issue, researchers and practitioners put enormous efforts into developing Cyber Threat Intelligence, or the process of identifying emerging threats and key hackers. However, the reliance on internal network data to has resulted in inherently reactive intelligence. CTI experts have urged the importance of proactively studying the large, ever- evolving online hacker community. Despite their CTI value, collecting data from hacker community platforms is a non-trivial task. In this paper, we summarize our efforts in systematically identifying and automatically collecting a large-scale of hacker forums, carding shops, Internet-Relay-Chat, and DarkNet Marketplaces. We also present our efforts to provide this data to the larger CTI community via the<a href = "www.azsecure-hap.com"> AZSecure Hacker Assets Portal</a>. With our methodology, we collected 102 platforms for a total of 43,902,913 records. To the best of our knowledge, this compilation of hacker community data is the largest such collection in academia, and can enable a numerous novel and valuable proactive CTI research inquiries.
